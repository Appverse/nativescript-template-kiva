# NativeScript Hackathon: template #1 - Kiva API

## Inroduction
This template has been created for the [Angular Connect Hackathon](http://angularconnect.com/2016/extras/), hosted by Progress Software.

Be sure to check the announcement, rules and prices at [http://angularconnect.com/2016/extras/](http://angularconnect.com/2016/extras/) under HACKATHON (of course).

## Getting started

Once you go through the [quick setup](http://docs.nativescript.org/angular/start/quick-setup.html) of NativeScript, the template should get you started with a sample app using Kiva's API:

- First launch the app generator, pointing to this template
```
tns create <my-kiva-app> --template https://github.com/Appverse/nativescript-template-kiva
```
- Launch the setup script (it will just move some files around)
```
cd <my-kiva-app>
app/setup.sh
```
- Run ```tns emulate ios``` and/or ```tns emulate android``` to make sure everything is in place and working
- Start hacking!

## Helpers
You should check [Kiva's guide](https://build.kiva.org/) to learn about the API.
